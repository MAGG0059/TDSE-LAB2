# TDSE LAB2 Manuel Alejandro Guarnizo

Implemented logistic regression from scratch using NumPy to predict heart disease risk from clinical data. Achieved 81.5% accuracy with comprehensive metrics and visualized decision boundaries across feature pairs. Added L2 regularization (optimal λ=0.01) improving generalization by 2.3%. Found ST depression and vessel count as most predictive features, while age-cholesterol showed poor linear separability. Demonstrated the complete ML workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation without using scikit-learn.
